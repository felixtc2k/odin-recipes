    <h1>Bourbon Chicken Recipe</h1>

    Bourbon chicken is a popular dish named after Bourbon Street in New Orleans and for the bourbon whiskey ingredient. If you double the recipe, make sure the chicken is still in a single layer. Laissez les bons temps rouler!

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅜ cup bourbon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried minced onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>    
    
<h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    Place chicken breasts in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    Mix together brown sugar, soy sauce, bourbon, dried minced onion, ginger, and garlic powder in a small bowl until well combined; pour over chicken. Cover the dish and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    Bake uncovered in the preheated oven, basting frequently, until chicken is well browned and juices run clear, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
